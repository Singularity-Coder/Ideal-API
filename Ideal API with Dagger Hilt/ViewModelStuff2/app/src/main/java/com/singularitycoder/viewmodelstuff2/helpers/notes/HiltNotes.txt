Hilt

Hilt constructs classes, provides containers and manages lifecycles automatically
Hilt has compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalabitliy,
Hilt auto generates containers

1. Activities and Fragments must have @AndroidEntryPoint
2. Must have Application class annotated with @HiltAndroidApp
@Module provides the dependency for us
Hilt provides dependencies through the constructor - ex; ViewModels get repository from its constructor
Dagger cannot inject dependency into a private or local field
For application context use the predefined qualifier @ApplicationContext and for activity context use @ActivityContext

Field injection is allowed in Activities and Fragments but in normal classes only constructor injection is allowed

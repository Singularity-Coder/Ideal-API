            We wondered what happiness would look like if we could give it a physical form.
            If I'm not mistaken, I think it was Suzaku that said that the shape of happiness might resemble glass.
            His reasoning made sense. He said that even though you don't usually notice it, it's still definitely there.
            You merely have to change your point of view slightly, and then that glass will sparkle when it reflects the light.
